# Project : Flexmoney Assessment
# What it does :

 
# How I built it
The frontend was implemented in react.js, using Figma for design and layout, and Axios to consume the backend.<br>
The backend was developed in node.js and express.js. Using some middlewares like jwt, to generate tokens, cors to enable the external ports for the frontend. And we keep the information in a NoSQL database, MongoDB.
