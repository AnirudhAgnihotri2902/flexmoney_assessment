# Project : Flexmoney Assessment
# What it does :
This project has a very interactive website which helps students to register for paid Yoga Classes in terms of monthly subscriptions in their chosen slots.
 
# How I built it:
The frontend was made using HandleBars, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive UI.<br>
The backend was developed in node.js and express.js. Using some middlewares like jwt, to generate tokens, cors to enable the external ports for the frontend.<br>
I have used MongoDB Atlas as Database for storing different tyes of data like user details, payment details, and slot booking details.
